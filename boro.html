      <p class="textw">Boro Ma, your strictness is that what has guiden us through the harshest of times. A parent being strict isn't always bad. In fact, when a child is ready for it, that child must recieve strictness from his mother for both getting diciplined and being ready to face harsh conditions. For that we are really grateful to you and we want your guidence in future. And without further redue, here is a sweet little wish from me. (totally not taken from ChatGPT)</p>
